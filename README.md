# üå± Smart Irrigation System using AI and Automation üö∞

This project is a **Smart Irrigation System** that uses **Machine Learning (XGBoost Classifier)** and real-time environmental data from **19 sensors** to automate irrigation decisions and control **3 water pumps** efficiently. The system predicts irrigation requirements for different zones based on parameters like **soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and water flow**, ensuring optimal water usage and sustainable farming practices.

The project workflow involves **data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and automation of irrigation pumps** based on real-time sensor inputs. **StandardScaler** is applied for feature scaling to improve model performance. The application interface is built using **Streamlit**, with a customized **CSS file for UI styling**, providing an intuitive dashboard to monitor sensor data and pump status.

### üöÄ Key Features:

* AI-based prediction of irrigation needs using **XGBoost Classifier**.
* Real-time zone-wise control of **3 water pumps** based on sensor data.
* **StandardScaler** applied for feature normalization and model accuracy.
* Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** with custom CSS styling for a clean UI.
* Scenario-based automation (individual pump ON/OFF based on zone moisture levels).
* Simulated real-time data input for testing system responses.
* Modular code structure for easy scalability and IoT integration.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies:

* **Python 3.10/3.11**
* **scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **pandas**, **NumPy**
* **Streamlit** for frontend interface
* **Custom CSS styling** for Streamlit app
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for data visualization
* **Google Colab / VS Code** for development

### üåç Future Scope:

* Integration with real IoT devices (soil sensors, weather stations)
* Weather API integration for predictive irrigation
* Mobile app development for remote monitoring
* Cloud-based deployment for real-time, large-scale farming solutions
